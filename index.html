  <h3>To all men dabbilng in pornography</h3>
  <p>
    The porn pandemic is engulfing the Christian world as well. The Barna Group discovered there is virtually no difference in the monthly porn use of non-Christian men (65 percent) versus Christian men (64 percent). Porn use is even worse among the
    younger Christian generation. In 2019, the Freedom Fight conducted a survey of more than 1,300 Practicing Christian college students from over thirty different campuses across the country. The men and women we surveyed were involved in a campus
    ministry, and they considered their faith in Christ to be very important to them. Many of them were leaders in their ministries. What we found was alarming. Eighty-nine percent of the Christian men surveyed watch porn at least occasionally.
    Sixty-one percent view it at least weekly and 24 percent watch porn daily or multiple times a day. Fifty-one percent of these men said they were addicted to porn. These are our future Christian leaders, husbands and fathers.
    But this is not just a guy’s problem. Porn use is also plaguing women in Christian colleges. Though growing in Christ is very important to these young women and many of them are in leadership in their campus ministry, pornography remains a part
    of their lives. Fifty-one percent of this group watch porn at least occasionally. Seventy percent of them either watched porn or had a sexual hookup in the last 12 months.
    To compound pornography’s pervasiveness, the “easy out” of porn surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The already unparalleled amount viewed increased by 12 percent in just the first three weeks of the lockdown. The Christian porn problem is
    getting worse not better. Our future Christian leaders, spouses and parents are having their hearts and minds captured by porn, and the impact is devastating.
